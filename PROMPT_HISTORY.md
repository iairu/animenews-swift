# 1. Deep Research (Gemini Pro Web exported to RESEARCH.md)

Do a research on what a good Anime News SwiftUI app should contain with main release being on macOS 12 and later iOS. I would like to only encompass RSS and website content that can be freely parsed or offers API free of charge. I want a complex app navigation ecosystem (Main Sidebar, Secondary sidebar in some views, Customizeable Toolbar, etc.) and possible inspiration by Apple Health app. List all things Anime (freely available). I would like to monetize the app by the use of advertisements and one-time purchase to remove the ads.

# 2. Feature Planning (Gemini Pro Web exported to FEATURE_PLAN.md)

[@RESEARCH.md](file:///Users/iairu/Desktop/SWIFT/animenews/RESEARCH.md) 

suggest file hierarchy for one alpha, one beta (more complex) and release (final complexity) version with short explanation for what to put into each file in a xcodeproj project that reflects the entirety of this research. map out all components, navigation and toolbar contents for both platforms, settings options, all static app text and where dynamic fields are located and from which source they're populated

# 3. Implementation (Gemini CLI in Zed)

work on the animenews.xcodeproj project to encompass all features, for now without external API access and with only placeholder values (so we can see how it looks on both macOS 12 and iOS 15)
